        <p>I'm a creative junior front-end developer who is looking to further my career by offering my skills and experience to a team where in return, I can learn, grow and develop as a professional.</p>
        <p>I would like to work on a wide variety of projects, so that I can expose myself to many different experiences. I want to not only code web apps, but also learn more about how they work, their architecture and design.</p>
        <p>My ideal work environment would be a small team, with a relaxed social atmosphere. I wish to work with colleagues who can teach me, then in return I can later teach others who are less experienced.</p>

            <p>As part of the UX studio’s team, I have worked on website design, prototyping and development for various clients, ranging from independent music producers and reporters to medical professionals, with an emphasis on usability.</p>
            <p>My work consisted of:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Prototyping, with software like Figma, but also paper and pen</li>
              <li>Participating in co-creation sessions</li>
              <li>Evaluating the usability of websites and interfaces</li>
              <li>Building websites with the Webflow CMS, to which I integrated external libraries, APIs and my own custom scripts</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The variety of the projects, as well as being in a small team, have helped me develop my sense of responsibility and adaptability. Being fully involved throughout the whole process of each project, from inception to delivery, has helped me grow and mature, especially in the junior phase of my career.</p>

            <p>During this internship, I coded the layout for various components and pages, then integrated them to Vue applications. As part of a small team of developers, I used Git to collaborate on these applications, and logged my tasks into Paymo to keep the team and client informed on my progress.</p>
            <p>The daily stand-up meetings with our clients helped me improve my communication skills, through providing concise reports of my work and translating client requirements into technical solutions.</p>
            <p>I also learned the basics of the Flux architecture using Nuxt, as well as some core vanilla Javascript concepts.</p>
